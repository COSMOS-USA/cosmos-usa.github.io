            <h2>Hello world! My name is Artem!</h2>
            <p>My name is Artyom Papenfot, I am 22 years old and I am a beginner web developer. I started my career as a developer quite recently, two months have passed, but I have already gained a lot of useful knowledge for programming and gaining more experience and enjoyment from the coding process. On my website I will tell you about myself, what I do and show you my latest work.</p>

              <p>Born in Kazakhstan, at the age of six he moved to Siberia, half Russian, half German. All my adult life I was and lived in the city of Barnaul, Altai Territory, when I turned 18, my family and I moved to the United States. Two years later, I found my way and started to delve into programming.</p>
              <h2 class = "h-right">Why did I start programming?</h2>
              <p>I was always amazed at what people do thanks to the code, I looked at these people and saw the future behind them, which will certainly change the world. Time goes by, technologies develop and gradually change the world in all areas of our life. Inspired by the achievements of other developers, I started my               journey in programming!</p>
